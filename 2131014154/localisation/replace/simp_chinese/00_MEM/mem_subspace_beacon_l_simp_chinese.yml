 mem_subspace_beacon_category_desc:0 "看上去，这个叫§Y[Root.GetName]§!的小行星内部隐匿着某些信标，同时我们也从环绕着那小行星的小小行星之间探测到了时不时重复发散的亚空波。"
 mem_subspace_beacon.1.name:0 "微型黑洞"
 mem_subspace_beacon.1.desc:0 "来自§Y[From.From.GetName]§!的异常信号源于一个直径不足数千米的不可思议的极小黑洞。它时不时将比仅有水果大小的微型小行星吸到视界旁边。根据科学家§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!的推断，由于该黑洞小的可怜的体积，被吸入的小行星和附近产生的亚空间干扰之间的联系密不可分。 真的，这绝对不是什么自然的鬼斧神工，里面一定有着什么值得我们去进一步研究的天机。"
 mem_subspace_beacon.11.name:0 "自动广播"
 mem_subspace_beacon.11.desc:0 "科学家§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!的报告指出，来自§Y[From.From.GetName]§!的神秘信号源于镶嵌在某小行星上的不明物体。 这玩意儿绝对不可能是我们的产物，毕竟那没有规律的亚空间信号是广播给这个星系内数个拉格朗日点的。\n\n 我们在成功破解后，一致认为里面包含了某些长者文明的自动全息影像。毕竟里面有着从一个小时到三个小时不等的全息影像段落，而每个段落又包含了这个长者文明所经历过的时代之一————似乎它们最后的辉煌仅仅比我们先进几个世纪而已。 每个全息影像呈现的时间、地点、人物和事件包罗万象，科学家§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!也借这宝贵的资料，分析出之前的异常就是为了广播这些内容的。 我们相信，深入研究全息影像中的内容不仅将有助于我们进一步了解这个奇妙的外星文明，还能为我们的大脑多充实一点点的写作灵感。"

 mem_subspace_beacon.21.desc:0 "It would appear that the \"asteroid\" of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! is not an asteroid at all, but rather a highly advanced swarm of nanobots.\n\nWhile the creator of the swarm is unknown, its purpose has been fairly easily deduced: By sending out a subspace signal, the swarm can detect the echoes of every object is present in the system, recording any ships in the vicinity.\n\nWhether this was - or maybe even still is - used for surveillance, research, or some other purpose is unknown, but what is clear is that it was not meant to be found - in order to maintain secrecy, the nanobots adopt the guise of an unassuming asteroid. Any disturbances on the surface by collisions are automatically repaired by the swarm before they continue their passive surveillance of the system. By launching missiles and various other objects at §Y[From.GetName]§!, we can watch the nanobots go about their work of repairing the \"asteroid\", giving us a glimpse of nanorobotics far more advanced than our current understanding of them."
 mem_subspace_beacon.100.name:0 "亚空间异常"
 mem_subspace_beacon.100.desc:0 "The subspace signals originating from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! appear to be originating from nowhere at all. They spontaneously generate from the exact centre of the asteroid, and §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has been unable to find anything out of the ordinary in the region.\n\nWhile certainly fascinating, the signals could easily be replicated in a laboratory, and with no culprit in sight, it looks as if the asteroid has no more secrets to give up."

 mem_subspace_beacon.150.name:0 "废弃的采矿无人机"
 mem_subspace_beacon.150.desc:0 "It would appear as though the subspace pings from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! were emanating from some kind of automatic mining station deep beneath the asteroid's surface. The beacon is an emergency signal, requesting aid from one of the station's allies.\n\nUnfortunately, the §Y[Root.Owner.GetName]§! is not one of these allies, and the station and its drones are equipped with weapons to defend their resource extraction operation. They have already opened fire on the §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
