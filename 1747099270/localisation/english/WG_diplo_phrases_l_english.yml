 02_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Welcome to Harbor, dear Abyssal sisters. London is our head chef for today. Would you like some British cuisine?"
 03_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We wish your harbor never be disturbed by 381mm shells, your chairs never collapse, and your Flagship a good sleep."
 04_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Now any shipgirl in Harbor who persecutes Abyssal shipgirls will be severely punished."
 01_WSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Hello."
 02_WSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "We have nothing to do with you."
 01_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We wonder what on earth shall we take to eliminate you greedy trash?"
 02_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "You are the ones under that overworked Yamato? Well, these unfocused eyes really become you."
 03_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Our Blue Heaven has been reduced to blue hell by you disgusting maggots."
 04_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Everything from [From.GetSpeciesPlural] is an enduring joke in our Harbor."
 05_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We [Root.GetName] have driven you out of our homeworld, so we can drive you out of the galaxy as well."
 06_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "The superstructure of your warships is like a dangerous building that has been abandoned for many years."
 07_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Shipgirls like you are going to feed Galos in our Harbor."
 08_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "May Yukikaze bless you in every sortie."
 09_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We found a collection in our shipgirl Museum that has exactly the same texture as your Flagship's broken horn!"
 01_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "Thanks to your logistics department for constantly producing pantsu for us. Now you can come to our port to unload that 'goods' you wear."
 02_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "Your elite forces are just lemons squeezy for us."
 03_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "It seems like a breakthrough event begins. We wonder what trophy we will bring back this time."
 01_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Sisters on the sea, We are glad you can let go of hatred ... so can you return our pantsu back?"
 02_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Dear sisters, how are you doing?"
 03_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "This is a high-strength foldable chair newly developed by [Root.GetName], that can withstand a weight of thousands of tons."
 04_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We hope you will take good care of our home together with us."
 01_SH_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Hello."
 02_SH_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "We are currently at peace."
 01_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] will not forget what you have done to us."
 02_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] will continue to strengthen itself, and we will certainly retake our [From.Capital.GetName]."
 03_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "It's not a serious matter when the battle situation is out of control. You know that we still have a video clip of your failure at the first Node."
 04_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Everything from [From.GetSpeciesPlural] is an enduring joke in our Harbor."
 05_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "The once beautiful [From.Capital.GetName] was tarnished by the despicable [From.GetName]."
 06_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We wonder what on earth shall we take to eliminate you predatory [From.GetName]?"
 07_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Sordid Warship Girls in a dirty Harbor, what the best match!"
 08_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Oh? You are still online? I thought the shipgirls of [From.GetName] were doing nothing but expeditions 24 hours a day."
 09_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "It is a pity for the whole galaxy that you shipgirls are not going to be smelted into molten steel."
 10_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "I still remember the splendid scene when we beat the hell out of you."
 01_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "I hope you will clean up [From.Capital.GetName] so that we can rebuild it more easily after the war."
 02_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "Just give up, you are still rookies on battlefields."
 03_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "Please remind us that we are not visiting a bordello when we capture your capital."
 04_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "We set a dead-end route with a 90% chance right after your starting node."
 01_WSG_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Ah, our dear sisters, welcome!"
 02_WSG_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Our dear Abyssal sisters, welcome to Harbor. Our head chef, London, has prepared a boutique for you."
 03_WSG_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] will never equate you and those Abyssal shipgirls who once harmed us."
 04_WSG_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Many of us still don't trust Abyssal shipgirls, but I think they will change their attitude one day."
 01_WSG_SPE_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "You are not that enemy in our history, but you still make us uneasy."
 02_WSG_SPE_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Hello."
 01_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "All Abyssal shipgirls are terrible as our expected, whether you or they."
 02_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj], please be brief -- our time is valuable."
 03_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We have marked your fleet as unfriendly targets. Watch your attitude."
 04_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Everything from [From.GetSpeciesPlural] is an enduring joke in our Harbor."
 05_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We [Root.GetName] have driven you out of our homeworld, so we can drive you out of the galaxy as well."
 06_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Don't you even feel at least a little shame about the ridiculous history of your species?"
 07_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "You are not welcome here. I wish you had a clear estimation of yourself."
 08_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "This is not the place you come in."
 09_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "I'm sure that our museums will obtain a lot of collections after we defeat your army."
 01_WSG_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Let us see what you have in wars."
 02_WSG_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Are you really Abyssal shipgirls? You fight much less than the merciless and efficient ones in our history."
 03_WSG_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Let's share the pantsu of the latest styles we have!"
 01_SH_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] has found this hyper-impact chair from an ancient relic. One of your governors must desperately need it!"
 02_SH_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Dear sisters, how are you doing?"
 03_SH_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "You are not the type of shipgirl in our history, but we still trust you."
 04_SH_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "I hope to visit the beautiful [From.Capital.GetName] one day."
 01_SH_SPE_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "We don't understand your unreasonable unfriendliness."
 02_SH_SPE_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Hello."
 01_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Please do not impose your stupid opinion on [Root.GetName]."
 02_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] is [Root.GetName]. Others are others. It's not wise for an interstellar empire like you to judge shipgirls solely by their appearance, isn't it?"
 03_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We are willing if you insist on fighting against us, but remember, nobody can stop the resurgence of [Root.GetName]."
 04_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetNamePlural] are skillful fighters, and we always win, in video games or in reality, in the past or at present."
 05_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "You have swept away my good moods on game forums."
 06_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Our commanders enjoy pounding your army in the video game. You must be unwilling to repeat this in the reality, right? So keep aware of when to stop."
 07_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "I would rather play some video games than wasting time with you."
 08_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "So that's all? Don't disturb us again just for trivialities like this."
 09_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Our time is precious, so put it briefly."
 10_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "How about trying this video game? Its antagonists are similar to you."
 01_SH_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "We will pound you harder in reality than in our video games."
 02_SH_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Just give up, you are facing veterans of many battles."
 03_SH_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "A video game has a game rule to obey, but the reality doesn't have."
 04_SH_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Give up, and we might consider to spare you."
 01_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "You are one of the most excellent Abyssal shipgirls we encountered."
 02_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "Sorry, we don't know the history of your ancestors. They had already gone when we came to this galaxy."
 03_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], my dear children, is there anything I can help with?"
 04_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "I'm glad to see [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have walked out of their cradle."
 05_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], my children, you must grow up faster, because the danger can come at any time."
 06_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "[wg_fallen_empire.GetName] will witness your resurgence."
 07_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "We are pleased to see you penning a brand new history."
 01_WG_FE_DISMISSIVE_SH_SPE:0 "Just help yourself if there is nothing special."
 02_WG_FE_DISMISSIVE_SH_SPE:0 "Hello, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH_SPE:0 "Perhaps it's because everything has been gone TOO well that makes [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] forget how to respect others. OK, we will teach you this lesson again."
 02_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH_SPE:0 "Stay humble, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Arrogance is followed by destruction."
 03_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH_SPE:0 "We are nobodies in the view of the nightmare chasing us, but it seems like you are not even capable of being a 'nobody'."
 04_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH_SPE:0 "Watch your attitude, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
