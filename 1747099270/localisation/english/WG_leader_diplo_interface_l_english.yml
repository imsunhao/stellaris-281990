 wsg.9999.desc:0 "$wg_mod_version$\n\nWelcome back Commander! This is the integrated menu of 'Warship Girls and Mist Species MOD', you can quickly access the all the functions of this MOD through the buttons set in this menu, including difficulty setting, Leader Affections/Wedding Ceremony, special leader contact (located at the far right of the interface), etc.\n\n§H because of the functions of this MOD at present It's bloated, so we will gradually phase out the old function entry§! (For example, some auxiliary functions that need to be opened by the edict, and the special contact interface that needs to be opened using the contact interface, etc.), §H then all functions of this mod will need to access via this menu. §!\NPlease forgive the inconvenience this may cause to your game."
